#SelfCrypto

[简体中文][1]

SelfCrypto provides decentralized key management and private dynamic authorization solutions for data encryption and decryption in the form of contract maintenance keys, and supports online text data encryption and decryption services after Google dynamic authorization

## contract

1. **goerli: 0x2c9C0c09568c4A29fc9eE934BF9671655b8a359D**

2. **mainnet: coming soon......**

## Architecture

![/docs/selfcrypto-en.jpg](/docs/selfcrypto-en.jpg)

> 1. **Contract: storage backend and web3 key, data extraction needs to be verified by the contract to verify the backend timestamp and the signature generated by the wallet**,
> 2. **Wallet: Including generating a signature for the backend timestamp and verifying it by the contract, interacting with the contract, and encrypting and decrypting the web3 key**
> 3. **Dynamic authorization: The dynamic authorization verified by the backend must pass the verification to complete the partial encryption, decryption and recovery operations of the backend**
> 4. **Online encryption and decryption: As an online encryption and decryption tool, it supports users to input or import text data for online encryption and decryption**
> 5. **Encrypted data hosting: The official professional version supports ciphertext data hosting after wallet and back-end obfuscation and encryption, including encrypted key/value data and encrypted files, etc.**

## Requirements
> - **1. The private key and mnemonic words of the web3 wallet are frequently lost, and huge amounts of funds are stolen, which poses a huge risk**
> - **2. A large number of centralized software and services require users to manage passwords, which is too cumbersome and insecure**
> - **3. Host security protection measures cannot completely prevent hacker intrusion, direct ciphertext storage, completely unable to decrypt operation plaintext**

## Features
> - **web3 contract; decentralized storage management mixed encryption key ciphertext guarantees tamper-proof**
> - **web2 backend: google dynamic authorization authentication and authorization recovery verification must be operated by myself**
> - **Data management: Only hybrid encryption and decryption services are provided as an online tool, and data plaintext and ciphertext are managed by the user**

## Safety
> - **web3: The anti-tampering feature of the decentralized environment is supported by the blockchain public chain contract (open source to github)**
> - **web2: Only as a dynamic authorization and hybrid encryption and decryption tool, the back-end key security is guaranteed by the contract and recovery ID (open source to github)**
> - **Front-end: only as a contract interaction and online encryption and decryption tool, it needs to cooperate with the back-end through google dynamic authorization (open source to github)**
> - **Key: The key is stored in the contract using web3 + web2 hybrid encryption to ensure that neither the wallet account nor the backend can obtain the plaintext alone**
> - **Data: The data is kept by the user in the way of web3 + web2 hybrid encryption to ensure that neither the wallet account nor the backend can obtain the plaintext alone**

## Usage

### 1. Regist
Registration is used to initialize the current wallet account inside the contract, requiring the user to enter the recovery ID

### 2. Recover
Recovery is used to reset the backend, you need to enter the encrypted ciphertext received by recoverID

### 3. Encrypt-Decrypt
After the google dynamic authorization is passed, enter the online encryption and decryption page, only the input text data or the uploaded text file is encrypted and decrypted, and the front end and the contract are not stored
